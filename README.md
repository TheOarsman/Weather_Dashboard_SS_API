## Description

Developers, ever tasked with integrating third-party APIs, can now effortlessly access weather data for cities with this browser-based weather dashboard. Leveraging the [5 Day Weather Forecast](https://openweathermap.org/forecast5), this dashboard dynamically updates HTML and CSS, providing users with accurate and up-to-date weather information.

Utilizing localStorage, the dashboard ensures persistent data storage, maintaining user preferences and settings across sessions.

## User Story

**AS A** traveler <br>

**I WANT** to see the weather outlook for multiple cities <br>

**SO THAT** I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria

**GIVEN** a weather dashboard with form inputs

**WHEN** I search for a city <br>
**THEN** I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

**WHEN** I view current weather conditions for that city <br>
**THEN** I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed

**WHEN** I view future weather conditions for that city <br>
**THEN** I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

**WHEN** I click on a city in the search history <br>
**THEN** I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## Installation

No installation needed. See link at top or below in Usage.

## Development

In the future, I intend to enhance the weather display by customizing the cards. Utilizing the icon codes provided by the 5 Day Weather Forecast, I will assign specific GIFs to serve as background images for each card.

Although I successfully deployed the feature, I encountered styling challenges in containing the GIFs within the cards themselves. You can find the relevant code in my script.js file, currently commented out. I aim to uncomment this code once I've resolved the styling issues.
